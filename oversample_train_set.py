'''
Oversample a training set:

1. Read all samples and group by class.
2. Determine the size of class 3 (the largest class).
3. Oversample classes 0, 1, 2 to match class 3â€™s size (with replacement).
4. Bootstraps of class 3: 
   a. Randomly sample with replacement to create a new set of class 3 samples of the same size.
   b. Find class 3 samples not selected in this bootstrap.
   c. Repeat bootstrapping on the unselected set until fewer than 10 remain unselected.
   d. For each of these remaining unselected samples, create 5 replicates.
5. Combine all samples and shuffle.
6. Write to a new file (e.g., train_mould_size_labels_balanced.txt).
